# Payy - ZK Rollup

An Ethereum L2 ZK rollup for privacy preserving and regulatory compliant transactions. 

Here are some highlights:

 - ðŸš€ Fast - runs in under 3 seconds on an iPhone
 - ðŸª„ Tiny - UTXO proofs are under 2.8KB
 - âœ… EVM - proofs are compatible with Ethereum 

For a detailed description of our architecture, please [download our whitepaper](https://polybase.github.io/zk-rollup/whitepaper.pdf) or visit our [docs](https://payy.network/docs).

| Ethereum Contracts | [eth](/eth)                             | Ethereum smart contracts to verify state transitions and proofs |
| Contracts          | [pkg/prover](/pkg/prover)               | Rust interface to Ethereum smart contracts                      |
| RPC                | [pkg/rpc](/pkg/rpc-server)              | RPC common utilities shared across all RPC services             |
| Smirk              | [pkg/smirk](/pkg/smirk)                 | Sparse merkle tree                                              |
| ZK-Circuits        | [pkg/zk-circuits](/pkg/zk-circuits)     | Halo2 + KZG ZK circuits for proving UTXO, merkle and state transitions      |
| ZK-Primitives      | [pkg/zk-primitives](/pkg/zk-primitives) | ZK primitives used across multiple modules                      |


## Tests

```
cargo test
```

Note: these tests can take a while to run on your laptop (e.g. more than 20 minutes)


## Audit

The ZK-Circuits and Ethereum Contracts have been audited by KALOS.


## Git LFS

We use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) for storing large files (e.g. srs params).

A one-time setup needs to be done for local development:

  1. Install `git lfs` following the instructions at https://git-lfs.com/
  2. Inside the `zk-rollup` root directory, run the following commands:

  ```bash
  $ git lfs install
  $ git lfs pull
  ```
